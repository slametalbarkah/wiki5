            Willyce Kim (born 1946) is an American writer. She is generally recognized to be the first openly-lesbian, Asian American poet to be published in the United States. Kim published her first book of poetry in 1971 and continued to publish poetry and novels throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She also contributed to a number of lesbian literary reviews throughout this time period. Her work is characterized by its celebration of lesbianism, strong women, and queer kinship.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background and education ==<br/><br/>Kim, who has lived in Oakland, California, since the early 1970s, was born in 1946 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Korean American parents. Raised Catholic, Kim attended Catholic schools, graduating with a degree in English literature in 1968 from San Francisco College of Women (later becoming Lone Mountain College, which, in turn, was eventually acquired by the University of San Francisco). While at San Francisco College of Women, Kim served as editor of Tradewinds, the campus literary magazine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Kim was an early member of the Women's Press Collective, an Oakland-based collective that facilitated the printing and distribution of self-published books by lesbians. Kim's later works were published by Alyson Publications, a Boston-based publisher specializing in LGBT literature.
