            The  Winchester Hotel  is a preserved commercial building, located at 531 Parliament Street, in Cabbagetown, Toronto. The former hotel building was listed as a heritage building by the city in 1975 and was designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1995.<br/><br/>It was one of the five or six major hotels in Toronto when it was built, until the King Edward Hotel opened in 1903.<br/><br/>The building was designed by architect Thomas Kennedy in the 1880s. It was known for having a dome on the roof, with a flagpole "that was visible throughout the city" <br/><br/>Plans to bring a Tim Hortons to the site in 2005 caused consternation among local residents and heritage activists. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Heritage details ==<br/><br/>The building currently known as the Winchester Hotel opened in the 1880s as the Lakeview Hotel. It once had a lantern mounted atop a cupola on the roof, that was removed, either in 1941 when it was given an Art Moderne facelift, or in 1954 (sources are unsure). A replica was added in 2021, using the same architectural firm that was renovating Massey Hall at the time.
