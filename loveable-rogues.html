            The Loveable Rogues were a British band from London, consisting of members Sonny Jay, Eddie Brett and Te Qhairo Eugene, who rose to fame after reaching the final of the sixth series of Britain's Got Talent in 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2010–12: Britain's Got Talent ===<br/><br/>In 2012, The Loveable Rogues were asked by Britain's Got Talent producers to audition for the show. They performed two of their original compositions on the show, "Lovesick" and "Honest", both which were positively received by fans and the judges alike and were written by the three boys themselves. They had a fanbase before appearing on the show.  They finished in fourth place with 5.7% of the final vote, behind the winners Ashleigh and Pudsey, and runners-up Jonathan &amp; Charlotte and Only Boys Aloud.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== 2012–13: Record deal and First Things First ====<br/><br/>On 12 June 2012, they informed fans to check the papers of tomorrow for 'good news!'. This turned out to be the fact that the band had been signed to record label Syco Music.<br/><br/>In late 2012, the band released a free mixtape through their Soundcloud channel. The collection of songs was released as a free download and was called 'First Things First'. Their debut single, "What A Night" was previewed along with new songs such as "Maybe Baby", "Talking Monkeys" and "Honest".
