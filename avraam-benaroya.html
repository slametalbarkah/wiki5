            Avraam Eliezer Benaroya (Hebrew: אברהם בן-ארויה; Bulgarian: Аврам Бенароя; Greek: Αβραάμ Μπεναρόγια; Ladino: Abrahán Eliezer Benarroya; Turkish: Avram Benaroya;  1887 – 16 May 1979) was a Jewish socialist, member of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (Narrow Socialists), later leader of the Socialist Workers' Federation in the Ottoman Empire. Benaroya played a key role in the foundation of the Socialist Worker's party of Greece in 1918, the predecessor of the Communist Party of Greece.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early years ==<br/><br/>Benaroya was born to a Sephardi Jew in Bulgaria.  He was raised in Vidin by a family of small merchants.  A polyglot, Benaroya learned to speak six languages fluently. He studied at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, but did not graduate, becoming rather a teacher in Plovdiv. Here Benaroya became a member of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (Narrow Socialists) (although other sources suggest that he joined the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists), he himself insisted that this was incorrect) and published in Bulgarian his work The Jewish Question and Social Democracy (1908).<br/><br/>After the Young Turk revolution of 1908 he moved as a socialist organizer to Thessaloniki. He founded here a group called Sephardic Circle of Socialist Studies and was in connection to the Bulgarian left-wing faction, close to the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), called People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section),  as well as to some Bulgarian socialists, who worked there. Benaroya's influence grew, as he argued that any socialist movement in the city must take the form of a federation in which all national groups could participate.
