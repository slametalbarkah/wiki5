            Wang Wujun (王武俊) (735 – August 9, 801), courtesy name Yuanying (元英), né Monuogan (沒諾干), formally Prince Zhonglie of Langye (琅邪忠烈王), was a Chinese military general, monarch, and politician during the Tang dynasty. He served as a long-time Jiedushi of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in Shijiazhuang, Hebei) during the reign of Emperor Dezong and ruling Chengde in a de facto independent manner from the imperial regime.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Wang Wujun was born in 735 and originally known as Muonuogan.  He was from Nujie (怒皆) tribe, of Khitan stock.  His grandfather was named Kenagan (可訥干), and his father was named Luju (路俱).  During Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Kaiyuan era (713-741), Luju followed his leader Li Shi (李詩), who took 5,000 households in crossing into Tang borders to submit to Tang.  Emperor Xuanzong praised them and allowed them to live in Ji Prefecture (薊州, in modern Tianjin).<br/><br/>It is not known when Wang Wujun acquired the name of Wujun, but it is known that by age 14, he was known for his horsemanship and archery, and he became as famous as Zhang Alao (later known as Zhang Xiaozhong) in the region.  Both of them later served the army officer Zhang Zhongzhi, who in turn served under the general An Lushan, who then controlled the region.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Service under Li Baochen (Zhang Zhongzhi) ==<br/><br/>In 755, An Lushan rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong, and soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Yan.
