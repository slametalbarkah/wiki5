            Shenley Academy (formerly known as Shenley Court Specialist Arts College) is a mixed secondary school and sixth form located in the Weoley Castle area of southwest Birmingham. It first opened on 4 September 2009. The school's academy sponsor is E-ACT, a non-profit education foundation.<br/><br/>In October 2018 the school received an Ofsted inspection stating that every area of the Academy was inadequate. With the results of this inspection the Academy was placed into special measures with a ‘notice to terminate’ letter delivered to E-ACT stating if actions were not taken to remove these special measures,  E-ACT would lose its sponsorship of Shenley Academy and Shenley would be transferred to a new Academy Trust. However in July 2021, Shenley had its first section 5 inspection since 2018. This report stated the school was now overall a ‘good provider’ school along with 3 out of the 4  areas inspected  named outstanding.<br/><br/>Shenley became an Academy in 2009, with many changes occurring in and around the school. One of these was its uniform; the blue and yellow that had been used previously, for over 40 years, was replaced by black and red uniform, accompanied by matching sports wear. The change to an academy also brought a large sum of money to the school, this ended up being used to construct a new £24 million building for the academy.
