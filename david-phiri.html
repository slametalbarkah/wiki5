            David Phiri (22 May 1937 – 16 January 2012) was a Zambian businessman who was a former Governor of the Central Bank of Zambia.  He was also Chairman of the Football Association of Zambia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and family history ==<br/><br/>David Phiri, or 'DARP', was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe, on 22 May 1937, to Abel Masewera Phiri and Elizabeth Sibanda. <br/><br/>His father, Abel had decided to leave Kapela village near Chadiza, Northern Rhodesia, to find work in the mines of Northern Rhodesia. Abel had the firm belief that the traditional village life of the African was going to end and turned down a Chewa chiefdom to enter the 'new world'. He left Kapela village on foot with two companions and ending up in a mine town called Kwekwe, where he found work at the Globe and Phoenix Mine. <br/><br/>Abel married a local of the Shona people, Elizabeth Sibanda, and David was born in the Globe and Phoenix mine compound, the only child of this marriage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>Phiri was an exceptional student, despite his tendency to play truant to play football which he preferred to the rigors of study, and was noticed by Mr. Green, a manager at the Rhodesia Iron and Steel Company where Phiri's father Abel was now Head Clerk. Green took personal interest in Phiri's education and encouraged him in school and gave him books allowing him to achieve high grades.
