            Block 185 is an office skyscraper located at 601 W. 2nd St. in Downtown Austin, Texas. The tower topped out in July 2021. The tower is the fourth tallest in Austin at 594 feet, and the tallest office tower in Texas outside of Houston or Dallas. Block 185 is bound to the west by Shoal Creek, to the east by Nueces Street, to the north by Second Street and to the south by Cesar Chavez Street. The tower is located on the final parcel of the former Green Water Treatment Plant and in Austin's Second Street District.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In the 1839 plan of Austin the property, along with three other adjoining properties, was designated for use as a penitentiary, however, a map of Austin from 1840 shows that lot split out into four tracks - Block 185, 186, 187 and 188. Eventually, the 1.26 acre plot of land would become the Green Water Treatment Plant  and, in 2012, it was purchased by a partnership between Trammel Crow and MSD Capital for $10,277,470. After many years of planning and many design changes, both increasing and decreasing in height, Block 185 started construction on January 16, 2019. Even after the groundbreaking, the tenants of the tower had not yet been announced and no renderings had been made public.
