            Francis Small (October 6, 1625 – ca. 1714) was a British-born Colonial American  trader and landowner who resided primarily in Kittery, Maine. He made the first recorded land purchase in what is now the state of Maine, then part of Massachusetts, and proceeded to amass so much property that he was called "the great landholder."  He owned the most acrerage of anyone who ever lived in Maine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and business ==<br/><br/>Small was born in 1625 to Edward Small and Elizabeth Shearte of Bideford, Devonshire, England, one of six children. He is believed to have arrived in New England with his father about 1632, the sole Small offspring to <br/><br/>come to America. In 1648 he was residing in Dover, New Hampshire, and married Elizabeth unknown of Kittery about 1650. While living in Casco (now Portland, Maine), in 1657, he bought from Scitterygusset, a local Native American sagamore, about 200 acres (80.94 hectares) located on the northern side of Capisic Brook. In 1659, Small established a trading camp on Sebascodegan Island, now part of Harpswell, Maine.  By 1668, he resided in Kittery, but operated a trading post (as a squatter) near the confluence of the Ossipee River and Saco River at what is now Cornish, Maine. Here major Indian trails converged—the Sokokis Trail (now Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (now Route 25), and the Pequawket Trail (now Route 113) – a location conducive towards lucrative fur trade with Indians, but also with risks of living isolated in the wilderness.
