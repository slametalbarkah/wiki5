He went to Northgate High School (Walnut Creek, California) and was one of many Californians to attend Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah and play on the school's golf team. In 1981, his junior year, he helped lead BYU to the 1981 NCAA Championship, and was named as a first team All-American. During his tenure at BYU, his teammates included future professional golfers Rick Fehr, Richard Zokol and Bobby Clampett. In his senior year, 1982, he was named as a second team All-American.

Later in that same season, he won the Centel Classic.
