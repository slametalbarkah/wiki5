            Caroline Wellwood (1870s – 1947) was a Canadian nurse, nursing educator, and Christian missionary in China.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Caroline Wellwood was born in Fordyce, Ontario and raised in Wingham, Ontario, the daughter of William Wellwood and Christiana Rodgers Wellwood. She attended the National Training School for Nurses and Deaconesses at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., graduating in 1902.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wellwood was head nurse at a maternity hospital in Boston as a young woman. She was assigned to the West China Mission (WCM) of the Canadian Methodist Woman's Missionary Society (WMS) in 1906, and arrived at Chengdu in 1907. She worked at an orphanage while learning Mandarin, then worked at a hospital dispensary. She became secretary treasurer of the West China Mission in 1909, and hospital superintendent. She and Anna Henry, a medical doctor, began working on building a new hospital.<br/><br/>Wellwood was evacuated from Chengdu in 1911, and stayed in Canada until 1913, lecturing and gathering supplies and funding for the hospital she hoped to build on her return. The Hospital for Women and Children at Chengdu offered sixty beds when it opened in 1915, with Wellwood as its superintendent of nursing.
