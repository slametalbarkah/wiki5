            Several Eastern folk religions practice in the worship of whales. This practice is common in Vietnamese folk religion, where it is known as Cá Ông. In Vietnamese religion, whales are believed to be guardian angels that protect fishermen. Beached whales are buried and given funerals, and festivals are held in honor of whales.<br/><br/>In Japanese mythology, the water deity Ebisu is associated with whales, and Ainu mythology features several cetacean deities. Whales have also played important roles in Korean, Chinese, and Māori mythology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Vietnam ===<br/><br/>The origin of Vietnam's whale worship remains unknown. Some people are believed that it came from the tradition of Cham people and Khmer people, who introduced it in the area in the 4th and 10th century. The ritual was also believed to have its origin in a Buddhist legend, the story told that after witnessing the plight of poor fisherman was caught inside the storms in South Sea, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva tore her cassock into many pieces and turned them into the whale to help the fisherman. She noticed that the whale could not withstand the power of the tempest, the Avalokiteshvara gathered elephant bones from the forest and the whale received it, which made the whale strong enough to overthrow the storm and save the man.
