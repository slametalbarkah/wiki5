            Philip Packer  (born 1972) is a British charity activist who suffered serious injuries while serving with the British military in Iraq in 2008 and has since engaged in numerous publicised physical challenges in support of his charity, the British Inspiration Trust (BRIT), and other causes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Surgery and rehabilitation ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Packer sustained severe spinal cord injuries in 2008, whilst on operational duty with British military forces in Iraq.  He had a motor-complete T12/L1 spinal cord injury, and was told he would never walk again. Following surgery and recuperation, his injury improved to T12/L1 motor-incomplete.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Physical challenges to raise funds ==<br/><br/>Following his recuperation, Packer has embarked on numerous publicised physical challenges, both to raise money, and to help himself recuperate psychologically from his injuries.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In February 2009, less than a year after his injury, Packer rowed the English Channel with Alastair Humphreys.<br/><br/>Next he entered the 2009 London Marathon. It took him thirteen days to complete the course, then the longest time in the event's history. By the end of the marathon he had raised £637,000 for wounded ex-servicemen.<br/><br/>The same year with support from an expert climbing team led by Andy Kirkpatrick, Packer was brought up El Capitan, the granite cliff in Yosemite National Park, over a period of 3 days.
