            Catherine Lucy Czerkawska, (born 3 December 1950) is a Scottish-based novelist and playwright. She has written many plays for the stage and for BBC Radio 4 and has published numerous novels and short stories. Wormwood – about the Chernobyl disaster – was produced at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre in 1997, while her novel The Curiosity Cabinet was shortlisted for the Dundee Book Prize in 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Born in Leeds, Yorkshire, to Julian Czerkawski and Kathleen Sunter, she attended Holy Family Primary School and Notre Dame Grammar School. The family moved to Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1962 where she attended Queen Margaret Academy in Ayr. After graduating from Edinburgh University with an honours degree in English Language and Literature with Mediaeval Studies, got a master's degree in Folk Life Studies at the University of Leeds. Her research dissertation on fishing traditions in South Ayrshire was the basis for her study Fisherfolk of Carrick, published in 1976, a work in which she commented on social relations and the role of women in that community:Fishing marriages have a long history of partnership, with the wife not only keeping house for her husband but actively participating in his work. When we hear of wives carrying husbands on their backs through the shallows to the boat, as happened in the old days, it isn't really an example of outrageous masculine superiority! It was simply much more practical for the woman to go back and dry herself beside her own fire (her house would be close beside the beach anyway) than for her husband to spend uncomfortable hours in a boat which would be quite damp enough anyway!<br/><br/>She taught English as a foreign language in Tampere, Finland for two years and at Wroclaw University, drawing on her Polish connections, (sponsored by the British Council) for a further year.
