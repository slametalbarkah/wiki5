            Shinoe Shōda (正田 篠枝, Shōda Shinoe, December 1910 – 15 June 1965) was a Japanese poet and author known for her atomic bomb literature.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Shōda was born in Etajima in Hiroshima Prefecture in 1910. Around 1920 her family moved to Ujina, just outside Hiroshima, and in 1925 she enrolled in a Jōdo Shinshū girls' high school, graduating in 1929.<br/><br/>In the late 1920s, she started publishing poetry in Kōran, a monthly literary magazine.<br/><br/>Shōda married engineer Takamoto Suematsu and the two had a son, Shin'ichirō. In 1940 her husband died and in 1945 her family home was destroyed, forcing the family to move into the city of Hiroshima. On August 6, 1945, the city was devastated by the atomic bomb attack. Shōda's home at that time was only two kilometers from ground zero. By February of the next year, her father had died of intestinal cancer and later her son also fell ill.<br/><br/>Following Japan's surrender, Shōda started writing traditional tanka poetry on the theme of the atomic bombing.
