            Full Attention was the first studio album by the contemporary Christian musician Jeremy Riddle. It was produced by Bob Hartry and released on March 6, 2007, by Varietal Records. The album has had commercial chart successes and received critical acclaima from music critics. "God Moves in a Mysterious Way" was taken from a William Cowper poem titled "Light Shining Out of Darkness". Songwriting credit should not be given without noting this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Music and lyrics ==<br/><br/>At Christianity Today, Christa Banister wrote that though he was "not necessarily reinventing the wheel here stylistically, Riddle handles modern worship as well as any — which should be more than enough to warrant your full attention." Ian Hayter of Cross Rhythms said that the "instrumentation is impressive and the singer's voice lends an air of real emotion to the set". At Alpha Omega News, Ken Weigman wrote that the album comes "with a state of the art production and skilled musicians, and you have one amazing project".<br/><br/>In terms of lyrics, Rachel Harrold for CCM Magazine wrote that the album has Riddle's "raw and passionate lyrics [which will] draw the listener into an atmosphere of worship". Banister wrote that "If solid lyrics weren't enough, the soundtrack provides plenty more to appreciate". Hayter wrote, "The songs bear the unmistakeable stamp of the Vineyard stable, with excellent guitar-based melodies and expertly produced arrangements forming the background for Riddle's articulate lyrics which draw you as the listener into his own personal spiritual space and then out again into full-blown worship of an awesome God." Weigman highlighted that "For the listener, this means passionate, moving lyrics and cut-to-the-heart vocals that can elevate you to a higher place of worship".
