            Yawning Man is an American experimental rock band from La Quinta, California. The band originally formed in 1986, although they released no studio recordings until 2005. They have been noted to be one of the first influential bands in the desert rock scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Yawning Man was formed in 1986, founded by Gary Arce, Alfredo Hernández, Mario Lalli, and Larry Lalli. At this time, the band started to play marathon jams during sets performed in the only readily available venues at the time: garages around town and impromptu concerts staged in the nearby desert. As word spread of these parties they evolved into what were called "generator parties" which were informal concerts held deep in the uninhabited desert outskirts of the cities in the Coachella Valley, gradually attracting larger and larger crowds to their shows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their music heavily influenced the likes of John Garcia, Josh Homme, and Brant Bjork (who would later form the stoner rock band Kyuss) to name only a few. When Hernandez played in Kyuss on their last album ...And the Circus Leaves Town (1995) they recorded a cover of Yawning Man's song "Catamaran".Yawning Man was the sickest desert band of all time. You'd just be up there in the desert, everybody'd just be hanging, partying. And they'd show up in their van and just, mellow, drag out their shit and set up right about the time the sun was goin' down, set up the generators, sometimes they'd just go up there and drink beers and barbecue.
