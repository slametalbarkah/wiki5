            Hamid Aboutalebi (Persian: حمید ابوطالبی, born 16 June 1957) is a former Iranian diplomat and ambassador. Aboutalebi was previously ambassador of Iran to Australia, the European Union, Belgium, Italy, and a political director general to Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was part of Iran's UN delegation in New York City in the 1990s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Professional background ==<br/><br/>Aboutalebi obtained his Ph.D. in historical sociology from  Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 1999, after completing master's degrees in sociology (from Sorbonne Nouvelle University, Paris) and in the history of Islamic civilization and culture (from Tehran University). Aboutalebi also earned his bachelor's degree in sociology from Tehran University.<br/><br/>His professional publications include Basic Challenges of U.S Foreign Policy towards Iran (2009), Rocky Mountains of Nuclear Extremism (2009), Turkey: Modern Diplomacy and New Ottoman Caliphate (2009), and New Challenges of Iran Foreign Policy towards the U.S. (2010). He published Anthropology of Ethics; First Volume of Philosophy of Social Ethics in 2013.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Controversy ==<br/><br/>It has been claimed that Aboutalebi was one of the student radicals involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans, including diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran, were held captive from 1979 to 1980.<br/><br/>Aboutalebi denied participation in the takeover of the US embassy, emphasising that he was brought in to translate and negotiate following the occupation. Aboutalebi was a student and member of the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, comprising students from several major science and technology universities of Tehran, which occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
