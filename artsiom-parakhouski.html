            Artsiom Parakhouski (born October 6, 1987) is a Belarusian professional basketball player for Śląsk Wrocław of the PLK. Standing at 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m), he plays at the center position.<br/><br/>He finished his American college career in 2010 with the Radford University Highlanders, located in Radford, Virginia. He led NCAA Division I in rebounds in 2009–10 at 13.4 per game. He was named the Big South Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 2009 and 2010, becoming the fifth multiple player of the year winner in Big South history.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Born and raised in Minsk by parents who both coached national Belarusian team sports, Parakhouski grew up playing football (soccer) until age 16. He was forced to switch to basketball, a sport he had never even played, when his body grew too large for any realistic football aspirations. <br/><br/>Parakhouski was spotted by Ali Ton, then a Binghamton University men's basketball assistant coach, at the Junior European Championships. Seeing his potential, Ton persuaded Parkhouski to first attend a junior college in the United States before enrolling at a major university to progress in basketball and to simultaneously learn English. At College of Southern Idaho, Parakhouski struggled to grasp the language, admitting "It was hard for me. The first five-to-six months I couldn't speak at all.
