            General Land Office Easements (also known as "government land office easements," and "GLO easements") were legal mechanisms which created right of way to ensure future access through, and to the interior of, lots or parcels created by the U.S. Small Tract Act of 1938, (52 Stat. 609, amended 1948, 62 Stat. 476; Not to be confused with the much later "Small Tracts Act" of 2002 which is applicable to handling and disposal of National Forest lands by the US Forest Service. The National Forests Small Tracts Act was amended in 2005, and/or 2015).<br/><br/>Lou Bellisi of PublicLands.org writes:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Small Tract Act of 1938 was enacted in response to requests by primarily World War I Servicemen who wanted to move out in the desert for health and recreational purposes. Subsequently, after World War II, Southern Californians began looking for small acreages in the desert to get away from the smog and burgeoning population centers. The Small Tract Act was about the only method of making federal land available. Local counties were enthusiastic about "getting lands on the tax rolls", and were not concerned about infrastructure (roads, water, power, schools) to support such development.<br/><br/>Small tract land patents were granted by the United States General Land Office (which merged with the United States Grazing Service in 1946 to form the US Bureau of Land Management). These patents transferred property owned by the U.S. government to private ownership.
