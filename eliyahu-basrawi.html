<h1>Eliyahu Basrawi</h1>
            
            Eliyahu Basrawi (born 1960) is an Iraqi–British dental surgeon and a former army officer. He served in the Iraqi Armed Forces under Saddam Hussein. Eliyahu served as a military doctor, during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War, despite being one of the few remaining Jews in the country at the time.<br/><br/>During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Eliyahu worked at Basra General Hospital as a senior house officer and registrar,  personally caring for soldiers with severe facial injuries. In the Gulf War (1990–1991), he was stationed near the front lines. Eliyahu survived bombings, severe shortages, and even a near-fatal misidentification as a corpse, earning admiration from colleagues for his resourcefulness and determination. His story of near to death experience was widely documented in the Jewish world, gaining global attention.<br/><br/>In 1991, following Iraq’s defeat in the Gulf War and amid civil unrest in the 1991 uprising in Iraq, Eliyahu escaped to Baghdad and ultimately fled to the United Kingdom with the help of a Palestinian and a Shi'ite Muslim. Today he lives there and gave interviews to many Jewish newspapers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Eliyahu was born into the small and dwindling Jewish community in Iraq in Basra, which numbered approximately 150 by the end of the 20th century.
