            Vitaliy Kalynychenko (Ukrainian: Віталій Калиниченко, January 31, 1938 - April 27, 2017) was a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.<br/><br/>Kalynychenko's first transgression of Soviet law was his nonagreement to work for the KGB. He was approached in 1964 to act as an informant, but his unwillingness to do so caused him to be arrested by a fellow student in 1965. He was released without charge, and worked in Leningrad as an electrical engineer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Arrest and Sentencing ==<br/><br/>On July 20, 1966, Kalynychenko was caught trying to flee to Finland. He was taken to Moscow, where, according to standard Soviet procedure, his mental state was examined. He was ruled sane by the Serbsky Institute of General and Forensic Psychiatry in Moscow, and stood trial.<br/><br/>On January 12, 1967, Kalynychenko was charged with "attempting to betray his homeland",  and was sentenced to 10 years in a harsh regime labour camp.<br/><br/>Kalynychenko protested to his sentence on the grounds that he had not been sentenced for trying to cross a border illegally, but rather that he was a political prisoner. In 1974, he sent an open letter in that effect to the presidium of the USSR (with a copy going to the United Nations).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ukrainian Helsinki Group ==<br/><br/>Kalynychenko joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Group on October 3, 1977.
