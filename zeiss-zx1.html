            The Zeiss ZX1 is a full-frame (35mm) fixed-lens digital camera produced by Carl Zeiss AG. It was announced in 2018, released in 2020, and discontinued in 2023. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Features ==<br/><br/>It is the only camera with Adobe Lightroom Mobile built in and one of very few which used Android as its operating system. The camera was marketed as with the tagline "Shoot. Edit. Share." due to its ability to allow users to create photos, edit them, and share them on social media on the camera itself afforded by those attributes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Reception ==<br/><br/>The ZX1 received reviews with mixed conclusions. There was strong agreement that its lens and sensor produced particularly high-quality images, but that its minimal physical controls and design choices made in priority of its visual design compromised its usability - a particular point of criticism was the camera's viewfinder: its rubber eye cup, in contrast with those of most enthusiast-level cameras, is close to flush with the body of the camera, which resulted in the reviewers' faces coming into uncomfortable contact with the body of the camera during its use, and that the camera's reliance on its touchscreen for control of many features made it especially awkward to make settings adjustments while using that viewfinder.<br/><br/>While the camera’s use of the Android operating system was praised for its versatility and ease of use, it was criticized for its long, 24 second, boot time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Lawsuit ==<br/><br/>In the book Focus: The ASML Way by Marc Hijink it is explained this camera was only introduced to be used in a patent fight between ASML/Zeiss (Zeiss SMT, the semiconducter part of the company) against Nikon.<br/><br/>The main fight was on lithography patents but with this camera they could also bring other patent infringements to court pressuring Nikon to agree to terms proposed.
