            Walton (perhaps formerly known as Walcot) is a hamlet in the parish of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, England.  Although Aylesbury has grown to such an extent that it completely surrounds Walton by a couple of miles in each direction, the hamlet is still marked on modern maps.<br/><br/>Walton sits north of the junction between two major turnpike roads, and was once the location of a toll gate and the toll keeper's cottage.  It has also, in its time, been the location of a foundlings hospital and a leper colony.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The hamlet name is a common one in England.  It is Anglo Saxon in origin and either means Walled Settlement or Settlement of the Walhs, the word 'walh' being an Old English word for Briton. There is evidence that there has been a settlement in Walton since the Roman occupation of England where remains of a Romano-British villa have been found.  There were also known to be Saxon houses in the vicinity of Walton in the 5th century.<br/><br/>The manor house in Walton was called Walton Court, and was a wattle and daub structure that was stockaded and moated and situated across the road of what is now Walton Terrace.  It was throughout most of its history owned by the Church, and revenue from the manor went to Lincoln Cathedral (it was mentioned in a charter to the cathedral by King William II).
