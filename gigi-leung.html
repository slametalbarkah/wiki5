            Gigi Leung Wing-kei (Chinese: 梁詠琪; born 25 March 1976) is a Hong Kong singer and actress.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>She was born at Tsan Yuk Hospital in Sai Ying Pun on 25 March 1976 and was given the name Leung Pik-chi (梁碧姿) for superstitious reasons; as a child, Leung suffered from frequent asthma attacks and it was believed a change of name would bring better health. At 176 cm, Leung earned the nickname of 'Tall Girl'. She has a twin brother named Keith Leung Wing-chun (Leung Wing-chun, 梁詠俊).<br/><br/>Gigi Leung attended Maryknoll Convent School. Later, she went to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University where she gained a diploma from the School of Design. It was during her study at university that she accepted a modelling assignment from the watch company City Chain and caught the attention of film director Lee Chi-ngai who cast her in her very first movie, Doctor Mack (1995). The success of the movie brought her a further role in Full Throttle (1995), shot while she was finishing her diploma. For her supporting role in the film, Leung received a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Her singing career began the following year with the debut album Love Myself (1996).
