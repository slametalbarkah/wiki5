            Bobby Brainard DuBose (born February 15, 1971) is an American Democratic politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 94th District, which includes most of Fort Lauderdale in central Broward County, from 2014 to 2022. DuBose served as minority leader with fellow Broward colleague as Evan Jenne co-leader for the 2020–2022 Legislature. On July 27, 2021, DuBose announced his resignation from the Florida House of Representatives, effective January 11, 2022.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/>DuBose was born in Fort Lauderdale and attended the University of Florida, graduating with a degree in economics and then working as a self-employed insurance agent. In 2009, he ran for the Fort Lauderdale City Commission from District III, and came in first in the municipal primary election, receiving 49% of the vote to Pamela Adams's 31%, Nadine Hankerson's 12%, and Magdalene J. Lewis's 8%. Because no candidate received a majority, a runoff election was held between DuBose and Adams, which DuBose won handily with 64% of the vote. In 2011, DuBose was elected to his second term without opposition and served as the Vice-Mayor of Fort Lauderdale from 2011 to 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Florida House of Representatives ==<br/><br/>In 2014, incumbent state representative Perry E. Thurston, Jr. was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, so DuBose ran to succeed him. He faced Lauderdale Lakes City Commissioner Levoyd Williams in the Democratic primary, which was an open primary because no other candidates filed.
