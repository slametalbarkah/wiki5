<h1>Wee Warriors</h1>
            
            Wee Warriors Ltd. was a game company formed shortly after the birth of role-playing games (RPGs) in the mid-1970s to publish RPG accessories. It was notable for publishing the first stand-alone  adventure for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, and for publishing the first character sheets for an RPG. The company thrived for several years while TSR distributed their unlicensed products. When TSR stopped distributing unlicensed materials, Wee Warriors tried diversifying, but ultimately ceased publication in 1978.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>When TSR's Dungeons &amp; Dragons began its quick rise to popularity, Pete and Judy Kerestan of El Segundo, California formed Wee Warriors in 1975 to publish accessories for the new game. For two years, Wee Warriors produced a variety of innovative products related to the D&amp;D RPG market, notably the first stand-alone adventure, and the first set of character sheets. Although they did not have a license to produce D&amp;D accessories, their early products were both promoted and distributed by TSR. <br/><br/>Then in late 1977, with the release of the new Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules, the rapidly expanding TSR stopped distributing third-party materials. Wee Warriors tried diversifying, designing a Star Trek board game, and promoting a new science fiction play-by-mail game. But the company was unable to regain traction in the marketplace, and ceased publication in 1978. <br/><br/>In 2019, the intellectual property rights of Wee Warriors were acquired by Precis Intermedia.
