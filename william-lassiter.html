            William Lassiter (September 29, 1867 – March 29, 1959) was a career officer in the United States Army. He was a veteran of the Spanish–American War, occupation of Veracruz, World War I, and the occupation of the Rhineland and attained the rank of major general.<br/><br/>A native of Petersburg, Virginia, Lassiter graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1889 and began a career in the Army's Field Artillery Branch. His initial assignments included coastal forts in New York and California. During the Spanish–American War, he served in Cuba and took part in the Siege of Santiago, for which he was awarded the Silver Star. He subsequently served on the West Point faculty and carried out several years of temporary duty with the Inspector General, including postings to Cuba and the Philippines.<br/><br/>During World War I, Lassiter was promoted to brigadier general and major general, and served in several important command assignments. In the war's final days he was assigned to lead the 32nd Division, which he continued to lead during the post-war occupation of the Rhineland. For his wartime service, Lassiter received the Army Distinguished Service Medal and several foreign decorations. After the war, Lassiter received several high-profile command and staff assignments, including commander of the Panama Canal Division and Panama Canal Department, the Philippine Department and the Hawaiian Department.
