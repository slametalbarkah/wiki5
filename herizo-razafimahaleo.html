            Herizo Jossicher Razafimahaleo (February 21, 1955 – July 25, 2008) was a politician in Madagascar. He ran for President three times, and he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister from 1997 to 1998.<br/><br/>As a youth, Herizo Razafimahaleo was a prominent Malagasy swimmer and set his country's record for being the longest uninterrupted breaststroke champion.<br/><br/>He attended the University of Antananarivo and later the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business where he obtained his MBA (later on in his life he also attended the University of Cambridge and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government).<br/><br/>Razafimahaleo was economic adviser to President Didier Ratsiraka from 1989 to 1991. He founded the LEADER Fanilo party in 1992 and was elected to the National Assembly in June 1993 from Ambositra. Razafimahaleo was named Minister of Industrial Promotion and Tourism in the government of Prime Minister Francisque Ravony in August 1993, but resigned from this position in July 1994. He founded the newspaper L'Express de Madagascar in 1995.<br/><br/>Razafimahaleo was the LEADER-Fanilo candidate in the November 1996 presidential election, winning 15.13% of the vote and taking third place. On December 28 he announced his support for Ratsiraka in the second round of the election, which was held on the next day; Razafimahaleo's support has been considered crucial in enabling Ratsiraka's narrow victory over former president Albert Zafy.
