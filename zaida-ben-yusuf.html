            Zaida Ben-Yusuf (November 21, 1869 – September 27, 1933) was an American portrait photographer based in New York. She was known for her artistic portraits of wealthy, fashionable, and famous Americans during the turn of the 19th–20th century.<br/><br/>In 1901, The Ladies Home Journal featured her and six other photographers as "The Foremost Women Photographers in America". In 2008, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery mounted an exhibition dedicated solely to Ben-Yusuf's work, re-establishing her as a key figure in the early development of fine art photography.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Ben-Yusuf was born as Esther Zeghdda Ben Youseph Nathan in London, England, on November 21, 1869, the eldest daughter of a German mother, Anna Kind Ben-Youseph Nathan and an Algerian father, Mustapha Moussa Ben Youseph Nathan. By 1881, her mother was living in Ramsgate and working as a governess, after separating from her husband and four daughters (Zaida (aged 11), Heidi (8), Leila (4) and Pearl (3)).<br/><br/>Later in 1888, Anna Ben-Yusuf emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts where she had established a milliner's shop on Washington Street in Boston by 1891.<br/><br/>In 1895, Ben-Yusuf followed in her mother's footsteps and emigrated to the United States where she worked as a milliner at 251 Fifth Avenue, New York. She continued this for some time after becoming a photographer, writing occasional articles for Harpers Bazaar and The Ladies Home Journal on millinery.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Photography career ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1896, Ben-Yusuf began to be known as a photographer.
