            Baron Yuasa Kurahei (湯浅 倉平, February 1, 1874 – December 24, 1940) was a Japanese politician and bureaucrat. He served as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan (1936-1940), Minister of the Imperial Household (1933-1936), Inspector-General of Korea (1925-1927) and President of the Board of Audit (1929-1933). He was a member of the House of Peers from 1916 to 1929. He held the court rank of Senior Second Rank.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life and family ===<br/><br/>Ishikawa Kurahei was born on February 1, 1874, in Uka, Toyoura, Yamaguchi Prefecture (present-day Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture), the second son of doctor Ishikawa Kōan and his wife Ichi. The Ishikawa family had been doctors and prominent village headmen of Uka for generations; Ishikawa's eldest daughter Tomoko had married Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo in 1867, and the family was later involved in the management of Mitsui Bank and served as mayor of Shimonoseki. Kurahei's family moved to Kōriyama, Fukushima Prefecture after his elder brother Tamenoshin opened a hospital there. In 1884, his name was changed to Yuasa Kurahei after his father was adopted by shizoku Yuasa Hisatsuchi of Fukushima Prefecture.<br/><br/>His higher education was financed by his brother Tamenoshin. He studied politics at Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in July 1898.
