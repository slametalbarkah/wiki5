            Jerome Namias (March 19, 1910 – February 10, 1997) was an American meteorologist, whose research included El Niño.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Jerome "Jerry" Namias was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the second son of Joseph Namias, an optometrist, and Sadie Jacobs Namias. He was raised in Fall River, Massachusetts. On graduation from high school, Namias was offered a four-year scholarship to Wesleyan University in Connecticut; however, because of his father's illness and the Great Depression, Namias decided to stay home and try to find a job to help his family out." He took correspondence courses, which allowed him to obtain employment in meteorology-related areas. Later he studied at the University of Michigan for one year, then joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1936 as research assistant. In the 1930s he studied the phenomena of the Dust Bowl. In 1941 he received his Master's degree from MIT.<br/><br/>From 1941 to 1971 he was Chief of the Extended Forecast Division of the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service). In the 1940s he developed the 5-day-forecast, and month and season forecasts in the 1960s. Further, he was responsible for forecasting for the Allies during World War II in Northern Africa.<br/><br/>Namias helped to develop the system of passenger flight weather forecasting, and researched the interaction between the oceans and atmosphere.
