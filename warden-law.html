            Warden Law is a village and civil parish in the City of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, England. It is south-west of Sunderland city centre.  It has a population of 33. At the 2011 Census the population remained less than 100. Details were included in the civil parish of Hetton.<br/><br/>It is home to a karting track called Karting North East and the Warden Law Kart Club. Just over the hill is a new children's farm activity centre Down at the Farm. The site is also the location of several prehistoric burial sites and other neolithic groundworks and remains. The site was also the location of the Warden Law winding engine from 1822 until 1959 which was used by the Hetton Coal Company railway to power one of the very earliest non animal powered railways seen anywhere in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The earliest reference to the village can be found in the Boldon Book of 1183, "In Warden Law there are 9 leaseholders who hold 18 bovates each of 13 1/2 acres and pay 8d for each bovate and they work 20 days in the autumn with one man for each bovate and they harrow for 4 days with 1 horse for every 2 bovates."<br/><br/>15th century records of John Wessington reported on by James Raine in the 19th century appear to show the hill within the village as being the place of the epiphany of Aldhun of Durham, the place where Aldhun claimed to have received a vision from Saint Cuthbert saying that the saint's remains should be laid to rest at Durham.
