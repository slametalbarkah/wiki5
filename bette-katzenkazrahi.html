            Bette Katzenkazrahi (nee Douglas; formerly Duke, Lakin, Goodman, Kennedy, and Davis) is a fictional character from the US NBC soap opera Sunset Beach, played by Kathleen Noone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>Carolyn Hinsey of the Daily News reported Noone's casting in November 1996. Noone previously appeared on daytime television for a number of years in fellow soap opera All My Children. Hinsey wrote that Noone had not ruled out a return to daytime television, after finding success in primetime, 'and she had said that she would embrace the chance to return if she found the right role. Of her casting in Sunset Beach, Noone commented: "This sounds like such fun." She later told Steve Gidlow of Inside Soap that when the character was explained to her, she thought that the role would be "delicious to play" and likened Bette to her favorite dessert, saying she was "that good!" Noone described Bette as "an Auntie Mame-type character".<br/><br/>In her fictional backstory, Bette has traveled around the world and has been married multiple times. She is a mother figure to Annie Douglas (Sarah G. Buxton). Noone called her character "outrageous" and said she gets away with saying things other people can only dream of. She also stated: "She's just so direct and open, which means she says it as she sees it. She's also kinda fun and brassy, and that's why the audience seems to like her so much."<br/><br/>Noone signed a new contract with the serial in August 1999, she also incorrectly predicted that Sunset Beach would not be axed by NBC. Of Bette, Noone stated: "She is a blast.
