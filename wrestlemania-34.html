            WrestleMania 31 was a 2015 professional wrestling event produced by WWE. It was the 31st annual WrestleMania and took place on March 29, 2015, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California. The event aired via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming. To date, this is the last WrestleMania to be held in March.<br/><br/>Nine matches were contested at the event, including two matches on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract as the scheduled match between defending champion Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns was in progress, and won the resulting impromptu triple threat match to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches, The Undertaker (in his first on-screen appearance since the previous year's event) defeated Bray Wyatt and John Cena defeated Rusev to win the WWE United States Championship. The event was also notable for Sting's debut match in WWE, as well as his only WrestleMania match, in which he was defeated by Triple H.<br/><br/>Despite criticism for its build-up, the event received highly positive reviews from fans and critics alike; some critics called it one of the greatest WrestleManias of all time. Praise was focused on the quality of a vast majority of the matches, as well as the ending of the main event. Another point of praise were the lack of matches considered to be "filler" and making the most of their time, while the women's tag team match was subject to this very criticism. Retrospective criticism has been focused on Triple H's win over Sting, which was viewed as an unnecessary ode to WWE winning the Monday Night War.
