<h1>Jim Clendenen</h1>
            
            James Alexander Clendenen (January 11, 1953 – May 15, 2021) was an American winemaker and the owner of Au Bon Climat, a winery in Santa Maria, California. Jim Clendenen was deemed "The Godfather"  of Santa Barbara County wine. He was key in raising international recognition of Santa Barbara County as a world class wine region, as well as being instrumental in raising the quality of Burgundian varietals on California's Central Coast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Clendenen was born in Akron, Ohio, on January 11, 1953.  His father, Donald, worked as a chemical engineer with Firestone Tire and Rubber Company; his mother, Alice, was a housewife.  Clendenen went to school in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, until grade nine, when the family relocated to La Habra, CA.  He completed his high school at Lowell High school before studying pre-law at the University of California, Santa Barbara, graduating with high honors in 1974.  He initially intended to work as a chef, having cooked in nursing homes and restaurants. His interest in winemaking was piqued after traveling around Europe as a junior.  He returned in 1977, staying in Bordeaux, Champagne, and Burgundy for six months.  He consequently opted not to enter law school and went into winemaking instead.
