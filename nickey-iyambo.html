<h1>Nickey Iyambo</h1>
            
            Nickey Iyambo (20 May 1936 – 19 May 2019) was a Namibian politician and physician who served as the first Vice President of Namibia. <br/><br/>A member of SWAPO, Iyambo was a member of the Cabinet of Namibia since independence in March 1990. He was the Minister of Health and Social Services from 1990 to 1996, Minister of Regional and Local Government and Housing from 1996 to 2002, Minister of Mines and Energy from 2002 to 2005, Minister of Agriculture, Water and Forestry from 2005 to 2008, Minister of Safety and Security from 2008 to 2010, and Minister of Veteran Affairs since 2010. He assumed the newly created vice president position in 2015 and served until 2018, when he retired due to poor health. He continued to head the Ministry of Veterans' Affairs until his death.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Iyambo was born in Onayena, Ovamboland, South West Africa, now in Oshikoto Region of northern Namibia. He went to a school that had been founded by Finnish missionaries near to his home, and having completed the school, we was given a job as Namibia's first Black postmaster from 1962 to 1963. However, having become a SWAPO member in 1960, he fled into exile with SWAPO in 1964, travelling on foot to Angola, continuing on to Zambia and Tanzania. He was amongst the earliest SWAPO members to go into exile and helped establish SWAPO's close relationship with Julius Nyerere's Tanzania.<br/><br/>At the time, Ylioppilaiden kansainvälinen apu (YKA, ‘Students’ International Relief’) was looking for projects it could fund, and its executive director Martti Ahtisaari was informed from Tanzania of Iyambo, and YKA offered a scholarship to him.
