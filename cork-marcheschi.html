            Cork Marcheschi (mark-e-ski; born April 5, 1945) is an American sculptor and musician, most notably recognized for his pioneering use of light in sculpture, his large body of public art work, and founding avant-garde psychedelic rock band Fifty Foot Hose. In the words of curator David Ryan, "Through art, music, writing, collecting and teaching, Cork Marcheschi saw the light early on — pursuing it in its many permutations — perfecting his artistry, a sculptural vision now widely admired."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Cork Marcheschi was born on April 5, 1945, to Italian immigrants Luigi and Aurora Marcheschi in San Mateo, California. His sister was Bonnie Lynn Tempesta, a baker and businesswoman who helped pioneer the gourmet food movement. <br/><br/>He enrolled at the College of San Mateo in 1963 to avoid the draft. Prior to enrollment, Marcheschi was training as a disc jockey and sound engineer, which led him to declare a major in telecommunications. He would later switch to art after being introduced to an avant-garde poem by Kurt Schwitters untitled "W" His reputation as a pleasant "outlaw" as described by 2001 exhibition catalogue, "Portrait of an Artist as Outlaw" largely evolved from his struggles with dyslexia. In 1966, he attended California State College in Hayward, California, By 1970, Marcheschi received his MFA and began to teach at Minneapolis College of Art and Design. He relocated from the San Francisco Bay to Minneapolis. Marcheschi obtained a master of fine arts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1966, Marcheschi enrolled in California State College and began to study art with Mel Ramos and Sy Weisman.
