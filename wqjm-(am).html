            WQJM (1230 AM) is a radio station licensed to Pineville, Kentucky, and serving the greater Bell County community. WQJM broadcasts with a full-time signal of 1,000 watts and on translator 98.1 W251CV.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>WQJM signed on on March 15, 1957, as WMLF, with the mission of serving the Pineville community with local news and information. The station changed its call sign to WANO in 1966. On October 16, 2023, WANO changed its call sign to WQJM to launch a brand new format and branding, “JAMZ 98”. The format is a mixture of today's hot hits, R&amp;B, and throwbacks from the '70s, '80s and '90s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Ownership ===<br/><br/>South Bevins was the original licensee of WANO and owned the station until approximately 1995, when the station was purchased by Warren Pursifull's Cumberland Media Group. Warren had begun working at the then-WANO as a teenager, leaving after his acquisition of Countrywide Broadcasters, Inc's WFXY/Middlesboro in November 1993.<br/><br/>In late 2005, both WANO and WFXY were acquired by Joshua Wilkey, a North Carolina businessman who moved to Bell County to run the stations. WQJM's studios are co-located with WFXY at 2131 Cumberland Avenue in Middlesboro. WQJM's transmission facilities are located on Four Mile Road just outside the corporate limits of Pineville.
