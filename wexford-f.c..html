            Wexford Football Club  is an Irish association football club based in Crossabeg, County Wexford. They compete in the League of Ireland First Division. The club joined the league after being awarded a First Division licence for the 2007 League of Ireland season. The opportunity to join the League of Ireland arose as Dublin City became bankrupt before the end of the 2006 season, leaving an uneven number of clubs. The 2007 season coincided with the takeover of the running of the league by the FAI and all existing clubs had to apply for entry into what was effectively a new league. Limerick was the only existing club refused a licence and so Wexford Youths and Limerick 37 were admitted to the new league. The club previously wore pink and black, before switching to a purple and gold combination in 2023. The club rebranded for the start of the 2017 season by dropping the 'Youths' from their title and changing the club crest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Founding years ===<br/><br/>Wexford Youths were founded by developer and TD Mick Wallace, who has funded the construction of Ferrycarrig Park, a state-of-the-art complex for the new team at Crossabeg, near Wexford Town. Wallace managed the senior side for the first three seasons, as well as the under-21s, under-18s and under-16s.
