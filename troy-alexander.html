<h1>Troy Alexander</h1>
            
            Paris (Ancient Greek: Πάρις, romanized: Páris), also known as Alexander (Ancient Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος, romanized: Aléxandros), is a mythological figure in the story of the Trojan War. He appears in numerous Greek legends and works of Ancient Greek literature such as the Iliad. In myth, he is prince of Troy, son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, and younger brother of Prince Hector. His elopement with Helen sparks the Trojan War, during which he <br/><br/>fatally wounds Achilles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Name ==<br/><br/>The Ancient Greek name Πάρις is probably of Luwian origin, and is  comparable to Parizitis, attested as a Hittite scribe's name. The name is etymologically unrelated to that of France's capital city, derived from the Gallic Parisii tribe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>Paris was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the Chronography as "well-grown, sturdy, white, good nose, good eyes, black pupils, black hair, incipient beard, long-faced, heavy eyebrows, big mouth, charming, eloquent, agile, an accurate archer, cowardly, hedonist". Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, he was illustrated as "fair, tall, and brave. His eyes were very beautiful, his hair soft and blond, his mouth charming, and his voice pleasant. He was swift, and eager to take command."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Family ==<br/><br/>Paris and the nymph Oenone had a son, Corythus.
