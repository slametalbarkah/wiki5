            Chris Eskola (born February 23, 1976) is musician from Boston, Massachusetts, locally known as a bassist who has performed with a number of hard rock, metal, punk, and experimental bands in the Boston area. Chris briefly attended Berklee in the late 1990s, and plays trombone in addition to the bass. He is currently the bassist for Matalon (with brothers Scott Matalon on guitar, and Craig Matalon on the drums) and Face of the Sun (with Brian Viglione of The Dresden Dolls, Ron Arra Jr. and Scott Matalon.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early musical roots ==<br/><br/>Eskola was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, but grew up in Westbrook, Connecticut. He started playing trombone at the age of 12 and eventually became the section leader of his high school's concert band and jazz/rock ensemble. At 14, a few of Chris' classmates had started a metal band and needed a bassist. Chris asked his father for a bass and an amp for Christmas and got his wish. This band became known as Glass Eyed Smash. and Chris was their bassist through high school. Chris also played for about a year with a local grunge band by the colorful name of Kermit Bloomgarden.
