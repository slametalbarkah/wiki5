            Wilsthorpe School (formerly Wilsthorpe Community School) is a co-educational secondary school and sixth form located in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, England.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>It opened in 1954 as the Wilsthorpe Secondary Modern School. Neighbouring the school was the Parklands County Secondary Modern School, which became an infants school. During the Eighties it was known as Wilsthorpe Community School.<br/><br/>The school gained Business and Enterprise specialist school status in 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The secondary school shares its site with Parklands Infants School and Harrington Junior School, enabling children to stay on the same site from their first year of school all the way to the Sixth Form of approximately 140 students. Also on the same site are Brackenfield Special School and English Martyrs RC Junior School.<br/><br/>Following its gaining Business and Enterprise status, the school used its capital grant to fund a separate building which was named The Enterprise Centre. In 2009 this was extensively refitted as a state-of-the-art teaching facility for 'catering'.<br/><br/>In July 2017, work began on the building of an entirely new school building, behind the existing school buildings, which was completed by September 2018.
