            Rice, Arizona was a populated place in Gila County, Arizona. It became a ghost town, and eventually its area was absorbed into San Carlos, Arizona. It is sometimes referred to as Old San Carlos.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>This area was known in the Apache language as Ni´té gochii, or the "Land that extends to the water". The town of Rice was first founded as "Twelve Mile Post"; later, in 1880 it was called "Talklai". The post office was officially named Rice in 1907, although the name Rice had been recorded previously. Eventually it was incorporated into San Carlos, and is sometimes referred to as Old San Carlos.<br/><br/>In 1873, the Aravaipa band of San Carlos Apache peoples were relocated from Camp Grant in the Aravaipa Canyon to the San Carlos Indian Agency along the San Carlos River.<br/><br/>The original location of the agency was abandoned, and was relocated eleven miles upriver to the town of Rice. The Apache families (a total of 645 people) were forced to relocate to the agency at Rice or to the Bylas reservation.
