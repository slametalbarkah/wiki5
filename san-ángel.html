            San Ángel is a colonia (neighborhood)  located in the southwest of Mexico City in Álvaro Obregón borough. Historically it was a rural community called Tenanitla in the pre-Hispanic period. Its current name is derived from the El Carmen monastery school called San Ángel Mártir. It remained a rural community centered on the monastery until the 19th and 20th centuries when the monastery  closed and  the area joined the urban sprawl of Mexico City. The area still contains many   historic buildings, and El Carmen is one of the most visited museums in the city. Its annual flower fair,  Feria de las Flores , has been held since 1856.<br/><br/>In 1934 San Ángel was declared  a Pueblo Típico Pintoresco (Picturesque Typical Town); in 1987 it was declared a historical monument zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>San Ángel is located in the southwest of the Federal District of Mexico along the southern end of Avenida Insurgentes, bordering the Ciudad Universitaria of UNAM . For most of its history, the area was politically and physically separate from the urban sprawl of Mexico City, becoming integrated with the city in the mid-20th century.<br/><br/>The community is surrounded by a volcanic rock bed called the Pedregal, which was formed by the eruption of nearby Xitle Volcano about 2,000 years ago.
