            William Christopher Zachary (February 19, 1944 – April 19, 2003) was an American professional baseball pitcher, a right-hander who appeared in 108 games, 40 as a starter, over a nine-year career in Major League Baseball for the Houston Colt .45s / Astros (1963–1967), Kansas City Royals (1969), St. Louis Cardinals (1971), Detroit Tigers (1972) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1973). Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Zachary batted left-handed and was listed as 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and 200 pounds (91 kg).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Baseball career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== With Houston ===<br/><br/>After starring at Knoxville's Central High School, Zachary signed with Houston prior to the 1963 season and spent his first professional season on the Colt .45s' National League roster. He made his MLB debut in the club's third game of the regular season, working one inning of a 7–1 defeat at the hands of the San Francisco Giants at Colt Stadium. The first three hitters he faced were future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame: Zachary issued a base on balls to Willie Mays, then allowed a single to Willie McCovey and a three-run home run to Orlando Cepeda. For his rookie campaign, Zachary worked in 22 games, with seven starts, and notched a 2–2 won–lost record and 4.89 earned run average in 57 innings pitched. However, 1963 would prove to be Zachary's only full year in the majors. In 1964, he won 16 games, losing only six, for the Double-A San Antonio Bullets and was chosen the Texas League pitcher of the year before working in one game for the Colt .45s at the end of the season. From 1965 through 1967, Zachary appeared in only 23 total games pitched for the renamed Astros, spending the balance of each season in Triple-A.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Remainder of MLB career ===<br/><br/>After working in eight games for the 1968 Oklahoma City 89ers, Zachary was acquired by the Royals, an expansion team set to begin play in 1969.
