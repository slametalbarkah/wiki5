<h1>Zarina Ahmad</h1>
            
            Zarina Ahmad is the Climate Change and Environment Officer at the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisation, Scotland (CEMVO Scotland) and an advocate for climate justice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>From 1986 to 1990, Ahmad studied for a BSc in psychology at the University of Glasgow. While at the university she was president of the society of Asian Students. Immediately after graduation she worked as an accountant and book-keeper. She then went on to work for Fife Education where her role was to determine whether a child's learning difficulties were due to an undiagnosed learning problem or poor knowledge of the English language.<br/><br/>When Ahmad managed a Scottish Climate Challenge Funded project in 2009, she realised that people from an ethnic minority background were not well represented at conferences and other meetings about environmental projects. Her personal background and experience led to her to advocate for climate justice and diversity within environmental movements.<br/><br/>Since 2013 she has been the Climate Change and Environment Officer at the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations, Scotland. The Council is an intermediary between organisations and the Scottish Government. Ahmad was appointed at a time when a Scottish Government report indicated that in the past four years only three ethnic minority groups had applied for funding on climate change issues from the Scottish Climate Challenge Fund, administered by Keep Scotland Beautiful.
