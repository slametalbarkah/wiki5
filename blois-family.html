            The Blois family (formerly spelled, and usually pronounced, Bloyse) have been substantial landowners in Suffolk for several centuries. Until recently the family home was at Cockfield Hall in Yoxford, Suffolk, a Grade 1 listed private house standing in 40 acres (160,000 m2) of historic parkland.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ipswich and Grundisburgh ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Blois family resided at Ipswich, and at Grundisburgh, near Woodbridge from the time of King Henry VII. Four generations were prominent merchants living in the parish of St Nicholas in Ipswich, of whom the first, Thomas Blois, is said to have married Margaret, daughter of William Styles of Ipswich, and died in 1528. (W.A. Copinger states that his father and grandfather were both also named Thomas.) The second, his son Richard Blois, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Roger Hill of Needham, lived in a house called "The Christopher", which at his death in 1559 he devised to the third, his son William Blois, who married Alice, daughter of William Nottingham, and died in 1607.<br/><br/>Thomas and William were both buried in St Nicholas's church, but Richard purchased property in Grundisburgh, and was buried in the church there. This property included an ancient farmhouse called "Sigers", which was added to by a younger William Blois (died 1621), an Ipswich merchant with houses in Ipswich and  Grundisburgh (who married Frances, daughter of John Tye of Ipswich), and by his son William. Thus improved, "Sigers" became Grundisburgh Hall. Part of the early 17th century Grundisburgh Hall survives: it represents one range (only) of a much larger building of 16th and 17th century dates which formerly extended to the south of the present house, and was knocked down during the 1960s.<br/><br/>William (died 1621) (a benefactor of the Ipswich Town Preacher Samuel Ward), whose lands in north Suffolk at Sandcroft, Homersfield and Mendham were left to his younger son Francis, sent his elder son William to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1617, from which he received MA in 1620, having entered Gray's Inn in 1619. This younger William married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Wingfield of Letheringham, and had 5 sons and 6 daughters.
