Co-founded by Andrey Stavnitser and Philipp Grushko, the center operates several departments, including surgical, traumatological, physical, PTSD and a pediatric reconstruction department. Howard Graham Buffett provided the initial funding of $16.3 million (USD).<br/><br/>On April 14, 2023, the hospital in Wynnyky, Lviv Oblast was ceremoniously opened after only 8 months of renovation in the presence of the President's wife Olena Zelenska and the Minister of Health Viktor Liashko.<br/><br/>Among the guests of honor at the opening was Richard Branson of the Virgin Group <br/><br/>The supervisory board of the clinic includes President's wife Olena Zelenska. Supporters include rock singer Sting and his partner Trudie Styler, actor and director Liev Schreiber, the British Virgin Group, and various American charities operating under the U.S. Charities covered by 501(c)(3).<br/><br/>On November 5, 2022, Ukrainian singer-actor Andriy Danylko, also known by his stage name Verka Serduchka, auctioned off his 1974 Rolls-Royce, once owned by Freddie Mercury, through London auction house Sotheby's for £250,000 to deal with the sale of the car to the Superhumans Center for support. The car, which was auctioned by Danylko in 2013 for £75,000, raised an additional £36,250 thanks to the sale house waiving the buyer's premium, raising a total of £286,250 (about €328,900).
