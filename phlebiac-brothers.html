            The Phlebiac Brothers are antagonists appearing in the Spawn comic book series.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Dubbed the "true denizens of Hell," the Phlebiac brothers are five powerful demonic beings, servants of Malebolgia. The Violator claims they were born of human mothers, but sired by a full-blooded demon from Hell, apparently for a project of John Dee; and that he, the eldest son, later killed their father. They each possess inhuman strength and invulnerability, as well as telepathic, regenerative, possessive, and shapeshifting abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Violator (also known as The Clown), the eldest of the brothers and the most prominently featured in the comics. He has blue-gray skin, a slender frame (in contrast to his more rotund figure as a clown), and large red compound eyes, with two horns protruding from the sides of his face, along with a single large horn on his back. He is initially sent to Earth by Malebolgia to train the newly reborn Al Simmons, but quickly comes to resent this role, as he considers himself to be superior to all Hellspawn and later to have designed the suits and powers for every hellspawn after the first. He acts as Spawn's archnemesis throughout the series.<br/><br/>Vindicator, the second-most featured in the comics. He has green-gray skin, slender frame, large red eyes with prominent eyebrows, and a large horn protruding from his back.
