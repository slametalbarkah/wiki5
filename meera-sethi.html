Throughout her oeuvre, Sethi looks at the meaning that people inscribe onto their clothing.

These investigations are broadened to include figures, both imagined and based on real people in subsequent works.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Upping the Aunty ===<br/><br/>Sethi's Upping the Aunty was a three-part project consisting of paintings, street photography, and an adult colouring book to celebrate the sartorial culture of the South Asian aunty.
