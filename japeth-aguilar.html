            Japeth Paul Cabrera Aguilar (born January 25, 1987) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He first played college basketball for the Ateneo Blue Eagles of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), but after two seasons, he moved to the Western Kentucky University Hilltoppers in the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== UAAP ===<br/><br/>Japeth Aguilar suited up as a college freshman for the Ateneo de Manila University Blue Eagles in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines in 2004. However, his first season stint was cut short due to appendicitis, but still managed to score 13 points, grab 11 rebounds and block 10 shots in 55 minutes of action in 10 games.<br/><br/>On his sophomore year, he bounced back from a disappointing first season as he averaged 5.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.2 blocked shots per contest to help lead the Blue Eagles to a 10–4 finish in 2005. He scored in double digits on three occasions, while he just missed a double-double twice after posting nine points and a career-best 10 boards in Ateneo's season opener as well as 10 points and eight rebounds later in the year in a win over Far Eastern University. Aguilar shot a high 55.4 percent from the field for the season, and he was credited with multiple blocks in 12 of the Blue Eagles’ 16 games — that included a career high of seven as well as two other contests with five or more. He led the UAAP in rejections during his sophomore season, with a total of 48 blocks in 16 games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== NCAA Division I ===<br/><br/>Japeth Aguilar later transferred to Western Kentucky University, where he saw action with the Hilltoppers mostly as a reserve. He entered the NCAA as a junior in 2007.
