<h1>Frederick Jellicoe</h1>
            
            Frederick Gilbert Gardiner Jellicoe (24 February 1858 — 29 July 1927) was an English first-class cricketer and clergyman.<br/><br/>The son of John Henry Jellicoe, a captain in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and Lucy Henrietta Jellicoe (née Keele), he was born at Southampton in February 1827. He was educated at Haileybury College, where he played for the college cricket and rugby teams. From there, he matriculated to New College, Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, he was a member of the Oxford University Cricket Club and made his debut in first-class cricket for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1877. After playing in the 1877 University Match against Cambridge at Lord's, Jellicoe made his debut for Hampshire against Derbyshire at Derby. He did not feature for the university in 1878, but returned in 1879, playing in a further six appearances. He followed this up with a further two appearances in 1880. In fourteen first-class matches for Oxford, he took 55 wickets at an average of 16.74; he took three five wicket hauls with best figures of 8 for 36. Jellicoe made three further first-class appearances for Hampshire in 1880, playing twice against the MCC and once against Sussex.
