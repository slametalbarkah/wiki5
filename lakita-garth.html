<h1>Lakita Garth</h1>
            
            Lakita Garth is an American sexual abstinence activist, public speaker, and rapper. Born in Los Angeles, Garth was a beauty queen, winning the title of Miss Black California in 1994. In the 1990s, she was a frequent guest on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, as well as being interviewed by outlets including Vogue and MTV about her advocacy. <br/><br/>Garth has testified before the United States House of Representatives on abstinence and teenage pregnancy. She has also written a book, The Naked Truth, on the subject, and recorded an inspirational rap album, Lakita (1999). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Garth was born in Los Angeles, the youngest of five children. Her father, a 27-year veteran of the United States Air Force, died of cancer when Garth was 11. Garth reflected that both her parents were strict, with her mother nicknamed "Warden". Garth's mother was a regular churchgoer, although Lakita refused to attend church as a child.  In high school, Garth says she was teased for being abstinent.
