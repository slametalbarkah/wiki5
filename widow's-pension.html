            A widow's pension is a payment from the government of a country to a person whose spouse has died.<br/><br/>Generally, such payments are made to a widow whose late spouse has fulfilled the country's requirements, including contribution, cohabitation, and length of marriage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== United States ==<br/><br/>During the Progressive Era, there was a proliferation of laws introducing widows' pensions (generally called "mothers' pensions) at the state level.<br/><br/>At the federal level, the widow's pension was introduced in the Senate in 1930. It was not especially uncommon for young women in Arkansas to marry Confederate pensioners; in 1937 the state passed a law stating that women who married Civil War veterans would not be eligible for a widow's pension. The law was later changed in 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions. <br/><br/>In 1899, Congress approved a payment of $11,750 of widow's pension owed to Harriet Tubman.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== United Kingdom ==<br/><br/>In the United Kingdom, the Widow’s Pension was discontinued in 2001. A widow's pension can be paid to childless widows aged 45 or over, or to those whose husband died before September 4, 2001.<br/><br/>When it was offered, for a woman to qualify, her husband had to have paid 25 flat-rate contributions before April 6, 1975.
