            Funen Series for men (Danish: Fynsserien for Herrer; Herre Fynsserien), also known as Albani Series for men (Danish: Albaniserien for Herrer) for sponsorship reasons, and often shortened to FS serien and FS Herre, is the highest division for men organised by the regional football association DBU Fyn (DBUF) and one of the fifth-highest divisions overall in the Danish football league system. The league, deciding the Funen Football Championship (Danish: FM for seniorer; Fynsmesterskabet), was first introduced with the 1904–05 season and throughout the years the competition format have gone through several series of changes. At the time of the league's introduction, it was placed at the top of the Danish football league system featuring the best regional amateur teams of Funen, but has since been moved to its current status as the fifth best level in Danish football, after a short period as the sixth best level, now featuring lower ranking amateur teams including the reserve squads of clubs playing at the Danish third league tier or above.<br/><br/>The division has changed its name on numerous occasions. It has previously been known as Førsteholdsrækken (1904/05–1913/14), A-rækken (1914/15–1925/26; or FBUs A-række, Række A) and Mesterskabsrækken (1926/27–1944/45; or FBUs Mesterrække to distinguish it from the other regional leagues; unofficially shortened to Mesterrækken), before settling with the current name of Fynsserien in 1945, eventually becoming Fynsserien for Herrer to distinguish it to the women's corresponding regional league, that was introduced in the 1970s. Ahead of the 2008/09-season, the Albani Brewery (since 2000 known as Royal Unibrew) obtained the naming rights for the highest men's and women's leagues under the auspices of DBU Funen, and both leagues have since respectively been known as Albaniserien for Herrer and Albaniserien for Kvinder.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the first couple of seasons, the Funen League Championship had to be won three times in a row, or four times in total, in order for a club to obtain the permanent ownership of the championship trophy, which otherwise would only be held by the reigning championship club for a year. The first trophy, made of silver and valued at 200 kr., was financed by the newly founded regional association (at this time named Fyens Bold Union), granted to Odense Boldklub in 1907 after winning the first three editions of the football championship. The second trophy, financed by the Danish FA, was reportedly also handed over to Odense BK after obtaining their fourth league title in 1916.<br/><br/>Between 1913 and 1931, the Funen championship clubs qualified for the provincial football championship, Provins-Fodboldturneringen, and until 1927 thereby the Danish national football championship, Landsfodboldturneringen.
