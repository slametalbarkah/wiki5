            Francis Fitton or Fytton (died 1608) was an English landowner and amateur musician.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was a younger son of Edward Fitton of Gawsworth, Cheshire, and Mary Harbottle, an heiress of Guiscard Harbottle of Horton and Beamish in Northumberland. His own estates were at Wadborough in Worcestershire (a Latimer property which had belonged to Katherine Parr), Binfield in Berkshire, and Heckfield, Hampshire, where he had a house called "Holleshotte".<br/><br/>In 1588 he married Katherine Nevill (died 1596), a daughter of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer. She was the widow of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. Fitton was a relation of hers and had been her steward, and in 1587 her son, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, attacked him with a rapier in her London townhouse. Fitton continued to be involved the business affairs of his stepson. He leased his own manor of Nun Monkton in Yorkshire (another Latimer property) to the Earls's solicitor John Carvile.<br/><br/>At the Union of Crowns in 1603, James VI and I and Anne of Denmark travelled to London, and aristocrats and gentry were keen to meet them on the way. Fitton wrote to his great-niece Anne Newdigate (1574–1618) with news of a delay to the queen's journey, caused by her miscarriage at Stirling Castle, "the Queene hathe had lately some myshapp, (which is not to be spoken)".
