            JKP Tower, formerly known as UMNO Tower, is an office building within George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. Built in 1998, the tower is located at the junction of Macalister Road and Jalan Zainal Abidin (formerly named Yahudi Road), within the city's Central Business District (CBD). It is owned by the Penang Bumiputera Development Council and functions as the state headquarters of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The building is recognised as the first skyscraper in Malaysia to utilise a wing wall system and other bioclimatic features to facilitate natural ventilation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The UMNO Tower was designed by local architect Ken Yeang, who was approached by a government-linked developer to create designs for a building on a 1,920 m2 (20,700 sq ft) plot of waqf land at the junction of Macalister Road and Jalan Zainal Abidin. According to Ken, due to financial constraints within the local Muslim community, the landowners stipulated that they would retain some degree of ownership of the property in exchange for proceeding with the project.<br/><br/>The waqf land originally accommodated a three-storey building owned by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). In exchange for the demolition of the old building, it was suggested that the new building could function as the Penang headquarters of UMNO, which formed part of the state government at the time. Construction began in 1995 and the RM35 million building was complete by the end of 1997. Opened in 1998, the building has since served as the state headquarters of UMNO.<br/><br/>In 2005, the tower was sold to JKP, a government-linked company that is part of the Penang Bumiputera Development Council.
