            The Honourable Richard Keppel Craven (14 April 1779 – 24 June 1851) was a British nobleman, traveller and author.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Craven was the third and youngest son of William Craven, 6th Baron Craven and his wife née Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, daughter of the 4th Earl of Berkeley. His parents separated when Keppel was only three years old and his mother moved to France with him, but it was under a promise to return him to his father when he was eight years of age. This condition was not fulfilled. They returned to England in 1791 to send Keppel to school at Harrow under an assumed name, where, however, he was soon recognised by his likeness to her, and henceforth was called by his family name.<br/><br/>His father died on 27 September 1791 and his mother in the following month married Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Craven was not by these events permanently estranged from his mother.<br/><br/>In 1814 he accepted the post of one of the Chamberlains to Caroline, Princess of Wales, without receiving any emolument; but this occupation lasted for a short time only, until the princess departed for Geneva. Six years afterwards he was called on to give evidence at the trial of the unfortunate princess, when he stated that he was in her service for six months, during which time he never saw any impropriety in her conduct either at Milan or Naples, or improper familiarity on the part of her Italian servant Bergami.<br/><br/>Having received a considerable addition to his fortune, Craven in 1833 purchased a large convent in the mountains near Salerno, which he fitted up as a residence, and there received his visitors with much hospitality.
